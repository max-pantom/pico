# Pico Test Suite

Standard prompts to validate the opinion loop. Run each with 4 directions to expose weaknesses in archetype fit, hierarchy, accessibility, and composition.

1. **Camera app first view** — quick capture, one handed use, flash toggle, gallery preview
2. **Music player first view** — album immersion, thumb friendly controls, queue access
3. **Messaging app first view** — conversation list plus unread emphasis, search, compose new chat
4. **Finance dashboard first view** — portfolio overview, risk alerts, filter, dense but readable
5. **Habit tracker first view** — today focus, streak, one primary action, friendly but not childish
6. **Map app first view** — location search, recents, one large map surface, bottom sheet details
7. **Game UI first view** — lobby screen, primary play action, secondary settings, strong mood
8. **Landing page hero only** — single value prop, two CTAs, social proof hint, accessible contrast
