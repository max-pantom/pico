# Pico Seed Packs

Seeds are "opinion packs" for rewriting, not for generation alone. Each seed directive must include:

- typography direction
- composition bias
- materials and surfaces bias
- prohibited patterns
- accessibility reminder

## Universal Constraints (add to every seed)

```
Avoid card grids unless dashboard archetype.
Use a dominant element.
Keep spacing on 8pt scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64).
Maintain AA contrast.
```

## Seed Library

Use the existing SEED_LIBRARY from designWorlds.ts. Each seed's directive is augmented with the universal constraints above when passed to the critic and rewriter.
