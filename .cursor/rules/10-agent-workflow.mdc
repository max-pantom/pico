# Agent Workflow Defaults

Follow `AGENTS.md` as the primary repo guide.

## Commands

- Install: `npm install`
- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Build (includes type-check): `npm run build`
- Preview: `npm run preview`

Current testing status:

- No test runner is configured.
- No `npm test` script exists.

If tests are introduced, prefer single-test execution first (Vitest/Jest), then full suite.

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript strict-safe patterns; avoid `any`.
- Prefer `import type` for type-only imports.
- Keep semicolon-free and single-quote style consistent with surrounding files.
- Preserve established architecture boundaries (`src/app`, `src/pipeline`, `src/renderer`, `src/store`).
- Keep diffs focused; do not perform broad refactors unless explicitly requested.

## Error Handling

- Fail fast on malformed external/LLM output.
- Use actionable error messages.
- Surface user-facing errors through store state (for example `setError`).
- Do not silently swallow exceptions.
